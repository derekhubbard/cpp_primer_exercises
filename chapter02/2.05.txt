Determine the type of each of the following literals. Explain the differences among literals in each of the four examples: 

a) 'a', L'a', "a", L"a"
'a' ==> character literal, type is char
L'a' ==> wide character literal, type is wchar_t
"a" ==> string literal 
L"a" ==> wide string literal

b) 10, 10u, 10L, 10uL, 013, 0xC
10 ==> integer literal, type is int
10u ==> unsigned integral literal, type is unsigned int
10L ==> integral literal, type is long int
10uL ==> unsigned integral literal, type is unsigned long int
013 ==> octal integral literal, type is int
0xC ==> hexadecimal integral literal, type is int

c) 3.14, 3.14f, 3.14L
3.14 ==> floating-point literal, type is double 
3.14f ==> floating-point literal, type is float
3.14L ==> floating-point literal, type is long double

d) 10, 10u, 10., 10e-2
10 ==> integral literal, type is int
10u ==> unsigned integral literal, type is unsigned int
10. ==> floating-point literal, type is double
10e-2 ==> floating-point literal, type is double
