To calculate a mortgate payment, what types would you use for the rate, principal, and payment? Explain why you selected each type. 

rate ==> unsigned float
- easily represents a percentage
- the rate will always be >= 0%
- could be represented using an unsigned float, but will be used for computations and the additional overhead will be negligible

principal ==> signed double
payment ==> signed double
- supports larger amounts, which one might typically see in mortgage calculations
