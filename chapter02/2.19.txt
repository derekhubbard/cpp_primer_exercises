Key differences between pointers and references

pointers
- objects, so when we assign a value to a pointer, we give that pointer a new value
- the value of this object is the address of another object, a null value, or the object immediately after an object

references
- not an object, so once the reference is defined there is no way to make that reference refer to a different object
- when using a reference, we always get the object to which the reference is bound
- just an alias to another object
