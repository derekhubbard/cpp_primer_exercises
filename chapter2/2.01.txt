What are the differences between int, long, long long, and short? 
They all support integers of varying size: 
short: minimum size of 16 bits
int: minimum size 16 bits
long: minimum size of 32 bits
long long: minimum size of 64 bits

Unsigned and a signed type? 
The integral types may be either signed or unsigned. A signed typed represents negative or positive numbers (including 0); an unsigned type represents only values greater than or equal to 0.

Float and a double? 
Both represent floating point types, typically with float represented in one word (32 bits) and doubles in two words (64 bits). The float and double types typically yield about 7 and 16 significant digits, respectively. Typically, use double for floating-point computations; float usually does not have enough precision, and the cost of double-precision calculations versus single-precision is negligible.
